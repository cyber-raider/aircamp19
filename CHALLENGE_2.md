### Challenge 2 - Wild blue yonder...
Now that you are getting familiar with Airman Joe's local linux system, lets 
take a look at his server (IP address: 10.0.0.25).  There are flags 
associated with all open ports, can you find them?

This challenge involves starting off with a scan of the given IP address using
nmap.
```
nmap 10.0.0.25
```

There should be 5 ports open (and 5 flags to find) does this mesh with a quick nmap of the server?
If not you might need to check some of the `nmap` options (`man nmap`).
(or maybe a google search for some nmap tutorials or examples).

Hints: 
* port numbers can vary from 1 to 65535
* these 5 flags vary greatly in difficulty, move on if you get stuck
* I may give out some additional hints, they should show up on this page as they
  are announced (you will need to refresh the page)
